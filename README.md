## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this course  

In **ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers**, you will learn how to use a **large language model (LLM)** to quickly build new and powerful applications.  

Using the **OpenAI API**, you‚Äôll be able to rapidly create capabilities that were previously cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible.  

This short course taught by **Isa Fulford (OpenAI)** and **Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI)** will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Summarizing** (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)  
- üîé **Inferring** (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)  
- üåê **Transforming text** (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)  
- üöÄ **Expanding** (e.g., automatically writing emails)  

You‚Äôll also learn:  

- Two key principles for writing effective prompts  
- How to systematically engineer good prompts  
- How to build a custom chatbot  

All concepts are illustrated with numerous examples, which you can play with directly in our **Jupyter notebook environment** to get hands-on experience with prompt engineering.

## About

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) to get the best possible outputs from AI models like ChatGPT. This repository contains resources, code samples, and practical guides to help developers master prompt engineering and build smarter AI-powered applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hasnain-dev-ai/ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-for-Developers.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-for-Developers
   ```
3. **Explore the folders and files** for prompt examples, guides, and scripts.

## Usage

- Review the prompt engineering guides in the `/docs` or `/examples` directory.
- Experiment with the sample prompts provided.
- Integrate prompt engineering techniques into your own projects using the provided resources.

## Examples

- **Basic Prompt:**  
  "Summarize the following text:"
- **Advanced Prompt:**  
  "Act as a professional copywriter. Rewrite the following paragraph to be more persuasive:"
- **Code-related Prompt:**  
  "Explain the following Python function step by step:"

See more examples in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  
If you have ideas, improvements, or new prompt examples, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
